      <description>When I was researching Droste images for a previous post, I occasionally came across versions which depicted multiple spirals, rather than the ordinary single spiral. This led me down a rabbit hole to understand what is actually going on in these images, and to see what I could make with the effect.</description>

      <description>The Droste effect is a name given to pictures that contain themselves, like an infinite series of nesting dolls. The conventional Droste effect is interesting, but it was taken to new heights by M.C. Escher&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Print Gallery.&amp;rdquo; I wanted to understand how Escher&amp;rsquo;s Print Gallery effect actually worked, and implement it myself.</description>
